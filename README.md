# Components
## Master 
The Master will consist of a laptop which will host an ad-hoc wireless
#network. It's primary job is to display productivity of the system.
## Slaves
The Slaves will consist of Raspberry Pi micro-computers which will
#connect automatically on detection of the ESSID for the Master's
#ad-hoc network. Each will each have a Controller which will perform the physical
tasks and relay back information.
## Controllers
The Controllers will consist of Arduino Megas and will be the primary
#workhorse of the system, specifically activating all servos.
